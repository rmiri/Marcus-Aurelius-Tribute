		<h2>Life</h2>
		<p>Marcus Aurelius (Latin: Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus;  26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was Roman emperor 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher. He was the last of the rulers traditionally known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He served as Roman consul in 140, 145 and 160.</p>
		<p>The reign of Marcus Aurelius was marked by military conflict. In the East, the Roman Empire fought successfully with a revitalized Parthian Empire and the rebel Kingdom of Armenia. Marcus defeated the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges in the Marcomannic Wars; however, these and other Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire.</p>
		<p>The Column and Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius still stand in Rome, where they were erected in celebration of his military victories. Meditations, the writings of ‘the philosopher’ – as contemporary biographers called Marcus, are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. They have been praised by fellow writers, philosophers, monarchs, and politicians centuries after his death.</p>

		<h2>Stoicism</h2>
		<p>Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness) for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.
		</p>
		<p>Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).

		<h2>Legacy</h2>
		<p>Marcus acquired the reputation of a philosopher king within his lifetime, and the title would remain his after death; both Dio and the biographer call him ‘the philosopher’. Christians such as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, and Melito also gave him the title. The last named went so far as to call him ‘more philanthropic and philosophic’ than Antoninus and Hadrian, and set him against the persecuting emperors Domitian and Nero to make the contrast bolder. ‘Alone of the emperors,’ wrote the historian Herodian, ‘he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life’.
